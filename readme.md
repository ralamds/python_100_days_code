# 100 Days of Code with Python: The Complete Bootcamp for 2023

This repository is a record of my progress through the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" course on Udemy. Over the course of 100 days, I will be coding for at least an hour each day, working through a series of Python projects and exercises designed to sharpen my coding skills and deepen my understanding of Python programming.

The course is divided into sections, each of which focuses on a different topic or aspect of Python programming. I will be working through the sections in order, completing the projects and exercises within each section before moving on to the next.

This repository will serve as a log of my progress, with each day's code stored in a separate file named according to the day and topic of the project. I will also include brief descriptions of each project and what I learned from it, as well as any challenges or roadblocks I encountered along the way.

I'm excited to embark on this journey and see where it takes me. Follow along if you're interested in learning more about Python programming or want to join me on the 100-day coding challenge!
