# 2: Data Type, Numbers, Operations, Type conversion, f-String.

Understanding data type and string manipulation

#### Date: 11 May 2023
#### Day Number: 2 of 100 
#### Project Description: 

- Data type refers to the classification of data in programming, which includes numbers, text, Boolean values, and more. 
- Numbers are a data type used for numerical calculations, and can be integers, floats, or complex numbers. 
- Operations are used to manipulate data, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. 
- Type conversion is the process of changing the data type of a value, such as converting a string to an integer. 
- f-Strings are a string manipulation technique that allows for the dynamic insertion of variables into a string. Understanding data types and string manipulation is crucial in programming, as they are foundational concepts for working with data and producing effective code.

#### Challenges: 

The coding challenge involves creating a program that calculates the amount each person should pay for a restaurant bill when split between a specified number of people, with a given tip percentage. The program should prompt the user to enter the bill amount, the number of people splitting the bill, and the tip percentage. The program should then calculate the total bill amount by adding the tip to the bill amount, and then divide that by the number of people to get the amount owed by each person. The program should format the output to two decimal places using either Python's round() function or string formatting options like "{:.2f}". The program should also include error checking to ensure that the inputs are valid numbers and that the number of people is a positive integer.
