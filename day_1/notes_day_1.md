# Day 1
## Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Printing to the console in python 
To print python code in the console, we use `print()` function. 
`print("Bismillah")`

### Commenting 
To make comment in python script, we use a # sign.
`# This is a comment. It will not be evaluated.`

### Debugging 
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors, bugs, or defects in software code. It involves identifying the source of a problem and correcting it, often through a series of trial-and-error steps.  

### String Manipulation 
String manipulation is the process of modifying or extracting information from strings (sequences of characters) in a program. This can include tasks such as concatenating two or more strings, splitting a string into substrings, replacing characters or substrings within a string, or converting strings to different formats or types

### Variables 

A variable in programming is a named memory location used to store data or values that can be changed or manipulated throughout the program's execution. It allows the programmer to refer to and work with data in a dynamic way, making programs more flexible and powerful.
