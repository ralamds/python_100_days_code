Challenges:
Today's challenge was a game called Treasure Island. The player has to make choices and navigate through the game to find the treasure. The game starts by asking the player to choose between going left or right at a crossroad. Then the player has to decide whether to wait for a boat or swim across a lake to reach an island. Upon reaching the island, the player has to choose between three doors: red, yellow, or blue. The game ends with different outcomes based on the player's choices. If the player chooses the yellow door, they win the game and find the treasure.
