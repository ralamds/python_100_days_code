#### Challenges: 

This project is about creating a rock, paper, scissors game. It requires the user to select a number representing their choice, and then compares it to the computer's randomly generated choice. The game prints the corresponding ASCII art for the selected hand signal and determines the winner based on the rules of the game. The debugging challenge requires fixing an IndexError caused by incorrect input validation.
